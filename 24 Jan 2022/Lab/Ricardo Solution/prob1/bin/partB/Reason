reason of problem B:

l2.contains (List.contains) contains method of interface List<>, At this example implements ArrayList<>; 
ArrayList.contains(Object o)  uses method indexOf -> indexOfRange. 

in indexOfRange method calls o.equals (o instance of Object), where it checks if this == o, it means it will 
check only reference to the object, but in our case we are checking name and salary, to make it work we need override 
equals method, in our case is overloaded. Input type is different. To correct it we need get Object argument and 
implement correct one as shown in solution.
