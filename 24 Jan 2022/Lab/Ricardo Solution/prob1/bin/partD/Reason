HashMap checks keys and adds to hash regarding objects hashCode. HashCode and equals implemented 
correctly. But there problem after adding to the hashTable e.setVisited = true -> changes object hashCode value, 
and it is not correct for further comparision. Thats why we need make all key elements (at this case all name salary and visited 
object members has to be immutable). To correct we just need to delete all setters and remove line set visited.
