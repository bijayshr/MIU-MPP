Here at this problem we faced incorrect override methos, because of using HashMap and particulary method 
containsKey() -> uses to compare hashcode of key object. but in our example as the key is Employee and 
all employee created have different object hashcode. Thats why we couldn't remove duplicates. 

to correct we need override key with differentiation members (name and salary).
